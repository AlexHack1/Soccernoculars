This program scrapes FBREF with BS4 to create a dataset of players for scouting and data analysis.
The script lets you select a year, league, and position and it will put together a generous set of stats from which you can conduct further data analysis.
It works with 10 major leagues, going back at least as far as 2017-2018. You can create multi-league datasets by appending the results of multiple script runs to the same CSV file.

Pip install the packages listed in the top of the main file before running.

Then, follow the input commands about selecting a league, year, and player position. Be sure to fill in a csv file path to write to in the main section of the script. This needs to be done 3 times across two lines. I will make this part more user friendly when I have more time.
